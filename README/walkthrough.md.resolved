# Fix for Visual Discrepancies on Railway

The issue where "it doesn't look like local" on Railway is caused by **Mixed Content**.
Your local environment uses `http://`, but Railway uses `https://`. Laravel was generating `http://` links for your CSS files, and the browser blocked them on the secure Railway site.

I have updated your application to force `https://` links when running in production.

## Changes Made

### Forced HTTPS Scheme
In [AppServiceProvider.php](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/FlotaVehiculo/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php):
```php
if($this->app->environment('production')) {
    URL::forceScheme('https');
}
```
This tells Laravel "even if you think we are on HTTP, generate HTTPS links because we are behind a secure proxy".

## Verified Items
- **Syntax Check**: [AppServiceProvider.php](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/FlotaVehiculo/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php) has no syntax errors.
- **Git Tracking**: Confirmed that [public/backend/dist/css/luxury-theme.css](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/FlotaVehiculo/public/backend/dist/css/luxury-theme.css) is NOT ignored by git, so your styles are correctly included in the repository.

## Next Steps for You
1. **Commit and Push**:
   ```bash
   git add app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php
   git commit -m "Fix: Force HTTPS in production to resolve mixed content"
   git push
   ```
2. **Deploy**: Wait for Railway to redeploy.
3. **Verify**: Open your Railway URL. The site should now look correct with all styles loaded.
